My Resume
## Bio
I am a recent Hyperiondev graduate, certified in Data Science, with an in-depth knowledge on Python, Data Analytics and Exploration, Machine Learning Algorithm using Scikit learn library, and python libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) , SQLite, Natural language Processing, Git, Tableau, PowerBI, Tensor flow and Keras. 
Additionally, I hold a M.Sc in Chemistry from University of Western Cape (UWC) and B.Sc I Mathematics from the University of Cape Town (UCT). I have strong technical, critical thinking and problem-solving experience obtained working as a Professional Officer at the City of Cape town operating in a 
laboratory environment, utilising standard operating procedures (SOPs), performing analysis, Quality control Charts (QC) and working with LIMS. 

Moreover, I have developed and improved my EQ, verbal and written communication, time-management, research skills, health and safety knowledge, hygiene, technical report writing, data collection, sampling techniques, presenting and initiating research projects by attending accredited courses. The working experience at Scientific Service branch 
at the City of Cape town and PetroSA Synthetic Fuels Innovation Centre (PFSIC), were a key influence in developing, enhancing and sharpening interpersonal and management skills.

I have a strong affinity to numbers, especially when they have assigned value in them. Hence I am aspiring to be an expert in data science, 
machine learning, quantitative analysis and natural language processing. I am passionate about education learning daily and be bale to pass on that knowledge to my juniors
